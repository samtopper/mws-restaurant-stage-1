# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course

This is stage-2 project of MWS nanodegree. 

In Stage Two, 
* I have taken the responsive, accessible design I built in Stage One and connected it to an external server. 
* I have used asynchronous JavaScript (fetch api) to request JSON data from the server. 
* I have stored data received from the server in an offline database using IndexedDB, which will create an app shell architecture.
* Finally, I worked to optimize my site to meet performance benchmarks, which I have tested using Lighthouse.


## Getting Started

# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course

This contains stage-1, stage-2 projects of MWS nanodegree. 

In Stage Two, 
* I have taken the responsive, accessible design I built in Stage One and connected it to an external server. 
* I have used asynchronous JavaScript (fetch api) to request JSON data from the server. 
* I have stored data received from the server in an offline database using IndexedDB, which will create an app shell architecture.
* Finally, I worked to optimize my site to meet performance benchmarks, which I have tested using Lighthouse.


## Getting Started

First, run the server from https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-2

then in this folder, 
run: npm install

& after successful installation of modules,

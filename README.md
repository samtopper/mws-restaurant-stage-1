# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course

This is stage-1 project of MWS nanodegree. 
For the Restaurant Reviews projects, I have incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage One, I have taken a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I have added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for my users.

## Getting Started

In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. 


### Prerequisites

Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000
